Making Sense from Sequence

``cogent3`` is a mature python library for analysis of biological sequence data. We endeavour to provide a first-class experience within Jupyter notebooks, but the algorithms also support parallel execution on compute systems with 1000's of processors. It be used for...

    ``cogent3`` provides an extensive suite of capabilities for manipulating and analysing sequence data. For instance, the ability to `read standard biological data formats <doc/cookbook/manipulating_biological_data.html>`_, manipulate sequences `by their annotations <doc/examples/seq_features.html>`_, to perform multiple sequence alignment (`app docs`_) using any of our substitution models, `phylogenetic reconstruction <doc/examples/index.html#phylogenetic-reconstruction>`_ and tree manipulation, manipulation of `tabular data <doc/cookbook/tables.html>`_, visualisation of phylogenies (`image gallery`_) and much more.

.. tabbed:: Modelling molecular evolution

    Differences in the frequency of nucleotides between species is common. In such cases, non-reversible models of sequence evolution are required for robust estimation of important quantities such as branch lengths, or measuring natural selection :cite:`2015.Kaehler.000, 2017.Kaehler.000` (`see using non-stationary models. <doc/app/index.html#the-model-app>`_). We have done more than just invent these new methods, we have established the most robust algorithms :cite:`2008.Schranz.000` for their implementation and their suitability for real data :cite:`2013.Verbyla.000`.

.. tabbed:: Beginner friendly

    You don't have to be an expert in structural programming languages (like Python) to use ``cogent3``! Interactive usage in Jupyter notebooks and a functional programming style interface lowers the barrier to entry. Individuals comfortable with R should find this interface less complex. (See the ``cogent3.app`` documentation.)
