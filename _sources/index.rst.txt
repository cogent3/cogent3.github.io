Making Sense from Sequence
##########################

``cogent3`` is a mature python library for analysis of biological sequence data. We endeavour to provide a first-class experience within Jupyter notebooks, but the algorithms also support parallel execution on compute systems with 1000's of processors.

``cogent3`` is released under the BSD-3 license, links to documentation and code are above. If you would like to contribute (and we hope you do!), we have created a companion `c3dev <https://github.com/cogent3/c3dev>`_ repo which provides `details on how to contribute <https://github.com/cogent3/c3dev/wiki>`_ and some useful tools for doing so.

**Who is it for? Anyone who wants to analyse sequence divergence using robust statistical models.**

``cogent3`` is unique in providing numerous non-stationary Markov models :cite:`2015.Kaehler.000` for modelling sequence evolution, including novel codon models :cite:`2017.Kaehler.000`. ``cogent3`` also includes an extensive collection of time-reversible models (again including novel codon models  :cite:`2010.Yap.000`). (`See using non-stationary models. <doc/app/index.html#the-model-app>`_). We have done more than just invent these new methods, we have established the most robust algorithms :cite:`2008.Schranz.000` for their implementation and their suitability for real data :cite:`2013.Verbyla.000`. Additionally, there are novel signal processing methods focussed on statistical estimation of integer period signals :cite:`2011.Epps.000,2012.Bellani.000`.

**Anyone who wants to undertake exploratory genomic data analysis**

Beyond our novel methods, ``cogent3`` provides an extensive suite of capabilities for manipulating and analysing sequence data. For instance, the ability to `read standard biological data formats <doc/cookbook/manipulating_biological_data.html>`_, manipulate sequences `by their annotations <doc/examples/seq_features.html>`_, to perform multiple sequence alignment (`app docs`_) using any of our substitution models, `phylogenetic reconstruction <doc/examples/index.html#phylogenetic-reconstruction>`_ and tree manipulation, manipulation of `tabular data <doc/cookbook/tables.html>`_, visualisation of phylogenies (`image gallery`_) and much more.

**Anyone looking for a functional programming style approach to genomic data analysis**

Our ``cogent3.app`` module (`app docs`_) provides a very different approach to using the library capabilities. Notably, a functional programming style interface lowers the barrier to entry for using ``cogent3``\ 's advanced capabilities. It also supports building pipelines suitable for large-scale analysis. Individuals comfortable with R should find this interface pretty easy to use.
