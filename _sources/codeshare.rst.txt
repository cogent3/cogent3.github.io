Code Sharing
************

If you've done something cool 😎 using a tool in the ``cogent3`` ecosystem that you would like to share (e.g. a new model, or some data sampling steps), you can do so on `our community contribution site <https://github.com/cogent3/c3codeshare>`_.

Contributing is as easy as clicking a button and pasting your code! Your contribution is posted as a GIST and links to your GitHub profile. Who knows, it may lead to collaborations 🙂.

If you want to see how others are using ``cogent3``, take a look at the site. (At the time of writing, this is very new, so there's not many contributions.)
