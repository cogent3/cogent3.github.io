Making Sense from Sequence
##########################

``cogent3`` is a python library for analysis of biological sequence data. We endeavour to provide a first-class experience within Jupyter notebooks, but the algorithms also support parallel execution on compute systems with 1000's of processors. It be used for...

    .. tab-item:: Data wrangling

        ``cogent3`` provides an extensive suite of capabilities for manipulating and analysing sequence data. For instance, the ability to `read standard biological data formats <doc/cookbook/manipulating_biological_data.html>`_, manipulate sequences `by their annotations <doc/examples/seq_features.html>`_, to perform multiple sequence alignment (`app docs`_) using any of our substitution models, `phylogenetic reconstruction <doc/examples/index.html#phylogenetic-reconstruction>`_ and tree manipulation, manipulation of `tabular data <doc/cookbook/tables.html>`_, visualisation of phylogenies (`image gallery`_) and much more.

    .. tab-item:: Modelling molecular evolution

        Differences in the frequency of nucleotides between species are common. In such cases, non-reversible models of sequence evolution are required for robust estimation of important quantities such as branch lengths, or measuring natural selection :cite:`2015.Kaehler.000, 2017.Kaehler.000` (`see using non-stationary models. <doc/app/index.html#the-model-app>`_). We have done more than just invent these new methods, we have established the most robust algorithms :cite:`2008.Schranz.000` for their implementation and their suitability for real data :cite:`2013.Verbyla.000`.

    .. tab-item:: Beginner friendly

        You don't have to be an expert in structural programming languages (like Python) to use ``cogent3``! Interactive usage in Jupyter notebooks and a functional programming style interface lowers the barrier to entry. Individuals comfortable with R should find this interface less complex. (See the ``cogent3.app`` documentation.)

📣 New Features & Announcements
===============================

.. dropdown:: 🆕 Cogent3 implements plugin hooks 🔌🪝🎉 

    We have implemented the infrastructure to support hook-style plugins. We have definied a single hook now -- the new type ``Alignment.quick_tree()`` method checks for an external plugin for calculation. There are no implementations available yet, but stay tuned as the developers of `piqtree <https://pypi.org/project/piqtree>`_ will be implementing support for this very soon.

.. dropdown:: 🆕 The release of piqtree 🎉

    The `piqtree <https://piqtree.readthedocs.io/>`_ project has made a major release. It now supports parallel execution for some functions.

.. dropdown:: 🆕 Cogent3 and Plotly blog post 😎

    A demo of the combined power of cogent3 and Plotly applied to the `analysis of SARS-COV-2 genomes <https://plotly.com/blog/decoding-genomes-cogent3-plotly/>`_.

.. dropdown:: 🆕 New core data types improve efficiency and flexibility

    The cogent3 development team 👾 have been hard at work modernising the core internals 💪🛠.

    The grand rewrite of alignment classes is ready for use! The new approach unifies the best features of the old classes plus gives us the foundation for major performance improvements in the future (see the next announcement). Try them out by setting ``new_type=True`` in the top level functions ``make_aligned_seqs()`` and ``load_aligned_seqs()``. The new types are not fully integrated into the existing code and can differ in their API relative to the old style classes.

    Please try them out and `give us feedback <https://github.com/cogent3/cogent3/discussions>`_!

.. dropdown:: 🆕 Faster pairwise genetic distance calculations 🚀

    We have completely rewritten a subset of the genetic distance calculators. These are now only available using the new type ``Alignment.distance_matrix()`` method. Single CPU performance is waaay faster 💨 plus they support parallel execution.

.. dropdown:: 🆕 A new tutorial on using non-stationary amino acid models 🧐

    A new contribution from Peter Goodman and Andrew Wheeler demonstrates how to specify a non-stationary amino acid substitution model. Check  out their :ref:`tutorial <nonstationary-model-aa-inference>` and `the original paper <https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.01.526552>`_. Thanks Peter, Andrew and their colleagues!
