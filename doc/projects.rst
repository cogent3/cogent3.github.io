`Spectral cluster Supertree <https://pypi.org/project/sc-supertree/>`_
    Spectral Cluster Supertree is a state-of-the-art algorithm for constructing rooted supertrees from collections of rooted source trees.

`piqtree2 <https://pypi.org/project/piqtree2/>`_
    piqtree2 is a library that allows you to use IQ-TREE2 directly from Python! The interface with Python is through cogent3 objects.

`EnsemblLite <https://github.com/cogent3/EnsemblLite>`_
    Command line tool for localising subsets of Ensembl data. It provides
    a command line interface for sampling related genes and whole genome
    alignments.

`c3dev <https://github.com/cogent3/c3dev>`_
    Tools for development of cogent3 and replated projects.

`MutationMotif <https://github.com/HuttleyLab/MutationMotif>`_
    Command line tool for analysis of mutation spectra including measuring neighbouring base effects.

`MutationOrigin <https://github.com/HuttleyLab/mutationorigin>`_
    Command line tool for development and application of machine learning classifiers for predicting mutation origins.

`geneticdistance <https://github.com/HuttleyLab/geneticdistance>`_
    Compute genetic distanxce using a non-stationary Markov model of nucleotide substitutions for molecular evolutionary analyses of DNA sequences.

`gnc <https://github.com/HuttleyLab/gnc>`_
    Model the effect of Darwinian natural selection using a non-stationary Markov model of codon substitutions for molecular evolutionary analyses of DNA sequences.
